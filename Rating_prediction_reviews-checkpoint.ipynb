    "We have a client who has a website where people write different reviews for technical products. Now they are adding a new feature to their website i.e. The reviewer will have to add stars(rating) as well with the review. The rating is out 5 stars and it only has 5 options available 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars. Now they want to predict ratings for the reviews which were written in the past and they donâ€™t have a rating. So, we have to build an application which can predict the rating by seeing the review. \n",

The graph in app is available at your finger tips.\\nBattery life is quit good hardly takes 40 min to charge from 0 to 100\\nThe display quality is fair enough with the price segment.\\nAlso the extra additional features given in this watch are so cool really useful. Honestly speaking I used find features twice ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… And trust me itâ€™s helpful for people like me who keep on forgetting things. The only features I found a off is BP Measuring but it is quit simple to understand that BP measuring is impossible to measure from wrist and Match results with readings from a medical device. Also BP Measurements is of least concern to me because with gods grace I got no such issues . Also had some queries in the beginning but the technical team they addressed it so well. Would say the support system is quit amazing.\\nOverall will say itâ€™s a wonderful product will a really amazing after supporting team behind it. Once should really try this Indian brand rather than trying some cheap Chinese brand whose only intention is to see product and earn profit.',\n",

I exchanged by Dell laptop which was i3 and 4gb ram and was very slow. For any decent use the minimum requirement is i5 with 8gb ram and in this product the SSD, turbo boost and graphics card makes it much faster.

    "The SGDClassifier guide on sklearnâ€™s site gives some reasonable ranges to search over for alpha and n_iter. It recommends the range 10.0**-np.arange(1,7) for alpha and np.ceil(10**6 / n) (n is the size of the training set) as a first guess for n_iter. Since our training size has 289,645 rows, it recommends a n_iter of 3, so we are going to try a couple of values around 3. For penalty, we are just going to try every possible value. Finally, we are going to try three loss functions: hinge (linear SVM), log (logistic regression), perceptron (perceptron algorithm)"
